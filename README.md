# Active-Directory-Project

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with a SIEM in an Active Directory environment, generating telemetry related to attacks actually seen in the real world so that I can better detect them in the future.

## Components Used

- **Active Directory**: Microsoft;s Active Directory is utilized as the directory service and identity management solution. It centralizes authentication, authorization, and configuration management for users, computers, and resources in a network environment.

- **Splunk**: Splunk is used as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) platform. It provides real-time monitoring, threat detection, and response capabilities for security incidents.

## Documentation

I will be documenting the project to improve my documentation skills and gain a better understanding of each day's work. I will do my best to provide accurate descriptions of each day, implementation steps, challenges faced and lessons learned throughout the project.
