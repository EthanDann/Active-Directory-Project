# Active Directory Project

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with a SIEM in an Active Directory environment, generating telemetry related to attacks actually seen in the real world so that I can better detect them in the future.

## Components Used

- **Active Directory**: Microsoft's Active Directory is utilized as the directory service and identity management solution.

- **Splunk**: Splunk is used as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) platform.
